## ABOUT this Project

In ancient times people used Hourglass to measure the passage of time. Hourglass is a simple device that consists of two glass bulbs that are connected vertically with a narrow neg and that allows the flow of sand or fluid from top to bottom. most of the time the flow duration is about one hour that's why we call hourglass. That's enough why I am taking this because this tutorial is about How to build a digital Hourglass using Arduino.
